                        <h2>Porcupine Puffer</h2>
                        <p>The Porcupine Puffer has spiny appendages that covers most of its body.  It has a defense mechanism of inflating their body by swallowing water or air to about double its size sticking its spines outward.  Some species have a toxin in their flesh and poisonous if ingested .  They have a beak-like mouth that are used for feeding on hard-shelled invertebrates.</p>

                        <h2>Lionfish</h2>
                        <p>Lionfish are known for their beauty and venomous fin rays.  They are slow-moving and conspicuous so they rely on on their distinctive brown or maroon and white zebra-like stripes, long fan-like pectoral fins, and dorsal spines for camouflage and to discourage predators from eating them.   They also carry venom in it's needle-like dorsal fins for defense.  Lionfish live in coral reefs and rocky crevices and rely on their lightning-fast reflexes to capture prey.</p>

                        <h2>Octopus</h2>
                        <p>The Blue-ringed octopus spends most of their time hiding in crevices and can change color to camouflage in its surroundings.  They are able to change shape easily and can squeeze into crevices much smaller than themselves.  The blue-ringed octopus carries enough venom to kill 26 adult humans within minutes with its bite, causing respiratory depression and paralysis.</p>

                        <h2>Jellyfish</h2>
                        <p>Jellyfish are invertebrates with a gelatinous umbrella-shaped bell and trailing tentacles.  The bell pulsates to squirt water from their mouths to propell forward.  Tentacles are used to capture prey or defend against predators by emitting toxins in a painful sting.</p>

                        <h2>Anglerfish</h2>
                        <p>The Anglerfish is a very unusal looking fish that many people believe are incredibly ugly while others consider them to be cute!  Anglerfishes are unique in having a fleshy growth from the fish's head that serves as a luring tool to capture prey. As the prey swims in to grab the bait the Anglerfish strikes with lightning speed.</p>
